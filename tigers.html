        <h3>TIGERS</h3>
       <p></p> Tigers are the largest members of the cat family, Felidae, 
        and belong to the genus *Panthera*. The most widely recognized 
        species is the Bengal tiger (*Panthera tigris tigris*), but 
        there are several subspecies, including the Siberian, Sumatran, 
        Indochinese, Malayan, and South China tigers. Once widespread across 
        Asia, tigers are now found primarily in fragmented populsations across 
        South and Southeast Asia, China, and the Russian Far East. These powerful 
        predators are critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife 
        conflict.</p>
        <p>Tigers are known for their striking orange coats marked with black stripes, 
          which are unique to each individualâ€”kind of like a fingerprint. They have 
          muscular bodies, large forelimbs, and powerful jaws that make them expert 
          hunters. Unlike most big cats, tigers are strong swimmers and often cool 
          off or travel through water. Males are significantly larger than females, 
          with some Siberian tigers reaching up to 3.3 m (11 ft) in length and 
          weighing over 300 kg (660 lb).</p>
         <p>Tigers are solitary and territorial carnivores, primarily hunting large 
          prey such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo. They inhabit diverse environments 
          including tropical forests, mangroves, grasslands, and snowy taigas. Tigers 
          rely heavily on camouflage and stealth to ambush their prey. Although they 
          prefer to avoid humans, conflict can arise when tigers venture into settlements 
          in search of food.</p>
